# Simulating Real-World Processes With SimPy

- Corresponding code for ["Simulating Real-World Processes With SimPy."](https://realpython.com/simulation-with-simpy/)

## Running the Script

The file `simulate.py` contains the script that mimics the tutorial code. You can execute the code by running `python3 simulate.py` from the directory that contains the file.

Here is some sample output:

```console
$ python3 simulate.py
Input # of cashiers working: 1
Input # of servers working: 1
Input # of ushers working: 1
Running simulation...
The average wait time is 42 minutes and 26 seconds.
```
